<h2>Project</h2>
<li>P1 participate：
<p>Name: Key technology development of bridge inspection equipment and intelligent analysis system based on AI technology</p>
<p>Start: 2020.11.1     &nbsp&nbsp      End: to now     &nbsp&nbsp      Funding: 430,000</p>
<p>Description: The project is a horizontal project in cooperation with Gansu Zhitong Bridge Inspection Consulting Technology Co. 
 The model can automatically identify common bridge bottom diseases and highlight the location of the disease, reduce the cost of
 bridge disease detection and help enterprises to transform intelligently.</p>
<p>Responsible for: hardware debugging; bridge bottom multi-image synthesis; bridge disease identification and localization model development.</p> 

<li>P2 participate：
<p>Name: Development and industrialization of gesture recognition system based on wearable smart terminal</p>
<p>Start: 2018.01      &nbsp&nbsp       End: 2019.12     &nbsp&nbsp     Founding: 5,000,000</p>
<p>Description: The project is a major thematic special project on artificial intelligence technology innovation in Chongqing, which focuses
 on the research of gesture and behavior recognition based on the motion sensors in smart wearable devices such as smart watches or smart wristbands.</p>
<p>Responsible for: the design of the entire system including data acquisition, pre-processing, recognition, and application.
 More importantly, development of algorithm for gesture and behavior recognition. </p>
